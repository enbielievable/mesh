                        <!-- Contextual Statement: -->
                        ‚ÄòMesh‚Äô explores ways of understanding the more-than-human world differently. Western science has
                        taught us that nature is separate from humans, that there are only two genders and that
                        (hetero)sexual reproduction is the norm. Queer Ecology seeks to challenge these assumptions,
                        blurring boundaries between well-established binaries such as culture/nature, male/female,
                        self/other, normal/abnormal etc.; oppositions that entail a hierarchy which deems the ‚Äòothered‚Äô
                        part inferior (Plumwood, 1993).
                        Lichens have been described as innately queer as their study requires us to think outside of
                        rigid binaries (Griffiths, 2015). They challenge primacy of (hetero)sexual reproduction
                        involving sexual and asexual reproductive strategies and, as a recent study suggests, it is
                        possible that some lichen species are able to reversibly or irreversibly switch between mating
                        types (Pizarro et al., 2019). Above all, lichens queer the notion of the individual, consisting
                        of two or more partners ‚Äì usually a fungus and an alga - that live in symbiosis, a mutually
                        beneficial inter-kingdom association. They represent a major actor in an ‚Äúecological mesh‚Äù where
                        interspecies collaboration is not an anomaly. Lichens are not either/or, they are both.
                        Photography too has been affected by binarist thinking. The concept of the negative/positive
                        binary has long accompanied our understanding of traditional photographic practices.
                        Historically, the negative has been described as depraved, ‚Äúan inversion of nature‚Äù (Batchen,
                        2020), as opposed to the positive that represents the ‚Äònormal‚Äô. Digital photography may not
                        involve the negative/positive binary anymore, but it is essentially made up of ones and zeros.
                        Based on a binary coding system, computers inevitably employ binarist thinking assigning
                        everything they can into black and white boxes, while erasing all that does not fit within this
                        notion of either/or (Bridle, 2022).
                        Exploring these concepts, I adopted a scientific approach of photographing the lichens isolated
                        from their environment and converted the resulting images into bitmaps, a file format that
                        consists of merely black and white pixels. Viewing the images from afar there is an illusion of
                        integrity and wholeness. Approaching, we realise that each image is just a matrix of black and
                        white dots, an orderly accumulation of binary numbers. Lichens, however, do not fit in black and
                        white boxes and their way of being is not easy to grasp. Perhaps an inversion of the ‚Äònormal‚Äô
                        will help us visualise what Queer Ecology suggests: a world without binaries where diverse
                        beings float in an ‚Äúopen mesh of possibilities‚Äù (Morton, 2010, p. 275).

                        Lichens
                        When Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener first suspected that lichens are not an individual being
                        in 1869, his theory was opposed by many scientists. The idea of species from two different
                        kingdoms so closely working together in the interest of both was incomprehensible from the
                        established perspective of taxonomy where species were considered to evolve from diverging
                        rather than converging with each other (Sheldrake, 2021). The term ‚Äòsymbiosis‚Äô was coined a few
                        years later by botanist and biologist Albert Bernhard Frank (1877) to name this mutually
                        beneficial association between a fungus and an alga. In the late 1960‚Äôs biologist Lynn Margulis
                        however expanded the theory of symbiosis to the whole world explaining that the story of
                        evolution is not about competition but about networking and collaboration (1999), a hypothesis
                        increasingly gaining proponents.
                        Today, whilst it is accepted that lichens do live in symbiosis, they still make us question
                        where the boundaries of a single organism begin and end (Griffiths, 2015). Furthermore, recent
                        studies have shown that some lichens involve even more than just two symbiotic partners and that
                        there is no ‚Äòbasic set‚Äô of partners that applies to all lichens (Sheldrake, 2021). The study of
                        lichens continues raising questions as they don‚Äôt seem to fit within the categories constructed
                        by Western science. As Sheldrake explains once the ‚Äòdual hypothesis‚Äô of lichens was established
                        ‚Äúevolution could no longer be thought of solely in terms of competition and conflict‚Äù (2021, p.
                        77).
                        In addition, the ecological importance of lichens is immense from many aspects. They are the
                        first to establish themselves in harsh conditions preparing the soil for the plants that will
                        follow (Sheldrake, 2021). They are involved in complex naturalcultural relationships with
                        humans, non-human animals and plants, serving as food, shelter, camouflage, decoration, medicine
                        and many more (Griffiths, 2015). Lichens represent a major actor in an ‚Äúecological mesh‚Äù where
                        interspecies collaboration is not an anomaly.
                        Last but not least, along with their symbiotic lifestyle they also demonstrate sexual and
                        asexual reproductive strategies challenging the primacy of (hetero)sexual reproduction
                        (Griffiths, 2015). Looking at lichens and recognising their queer way of being enables us to let
                        go of the preconceived categories we learnt to ascribe to everything. Binary categories don‚Äôt
                        help us understand the world better, rather they conceal a huge rainbow of diversity.
